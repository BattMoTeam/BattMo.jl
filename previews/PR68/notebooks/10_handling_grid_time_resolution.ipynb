    "\n",
    "Until now we have seen three different input types that can be used to define a simulation in BattMo:\n",
    "- CellParameters : defines the physical and chemical properties of the battery cell\n",
    "- CyclingProtocol : defines the current/voltage profile that the cell is subjected to during the simulation\n",
    "- ModelSettings :   defines various settings for the battery model, such as which submodels to use\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these, there is a fourth input type called SimulationSettings.\n",
    "These settings allow you to control the time step and grid resolution for your simulations.\n",
    "This can be useful for balancing accuracy and computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to change these settings."
