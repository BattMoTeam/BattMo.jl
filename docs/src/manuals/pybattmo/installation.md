# PyBattMo
**BattMo.jl is available from Python!**
We’ve created PyBattMo, a Python wrapper for BattMo.jl, allowing you to access all of BattMo’s functionality directly from Python. If you’re more comfortable coding in Python but want to take advantage of BattMo, you can now do so seamlessly. 

Easily install PyBattMo via pip:

```
pip install battmo
```

The APIs of BattMo.jl and PyBattMo are very similar, and even BattMo’s plotting functions are supported.
