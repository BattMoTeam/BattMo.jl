The main entry to the simulator is the function [`run_battery`](@ref). 

This function takes an input object which can be generated by a json file using the function
[`readBattMoJsonInputFile`](@ref). We also provide to the possibility to run a simulation from a model setup using
Matlab.

Therefore, a description of the API at the public level consists of the description of the json input file format.

In this [directory](https://github.com/BattMoTeam/BattMo.jl/blob/main/test/data/jsonfiles/), we have collected json input files
