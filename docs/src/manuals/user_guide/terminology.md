# Terminology


## Parameters
A user would normally control these in real experiments.

According to what they describe:
- Cell parameters
- Cycling parameters

According to how they are described:
- Scalar parameters
- Functional parameters

### Cell parameters
The parameters that characterize a battery cell.

### Cyling parameters
The parameters that define how the cell is operated during a Simulation (Experiment).

## Settings
Needed for the solver to set the numerical assumptions to find the numerical solution.

### Model settings
The setting that define some numerical assumptions about the model.

### Simulation settings
The settings that define numerical assumptions about the simulation.

According to what they describe:
- Grid settings
- Time step settings
