The Battery Modelling Toolbox (**BattMo**) is a resource for continuum modelling of electrochemical devices in MATLAB. The code features a pseudo X-dimensional (PXD) framework for the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model of lithium-ion battery cells. The code implements a subset of features from the [MATLAB version of BattMo](https://github.com/BattMoTeam/BattMo) with improved numerical performance. **BattMo.jl** is based on [Jutul.jl](https://github.com/sintefmath/Jutul.jl) and uses finite-volume discretizations and automatic differentiation to simulate models in 1D, 2D and 3D.

The current implementation has many options for setting up simulation cases:

- Set up 1D, 2D and 3D grids using scripting syntax
- Templates for different types of battery chemistry parameters in JSON format
- Support for a variety of open formats
- Read in input data prepared in the MATLAB version of BattMo (coin-cell, jellyroll, pouch)
- Make use of common BattMo JSON format to run cases
