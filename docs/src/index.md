The Battery Modelling Toolbox (**BattMo**) is a resource for continuum modelling of electrochemical devices in MATLAB. The code features a pseudo X-dimensional (PXD) framework for the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model of lithium-ion battery cells. The code implements a subset of features from the [MATLAB version of BattMo](https://github.com/BattMoTeam/BattMo) with improved numerical performance. **BattMo.jl** is based on [Jutul.jl](https://github.com/sintefmath/Jutul.jl) and uses finite-volume discretizations and automatic differentiation to simulate models in 1D, 2D and 3D.

The current implementation has many options for setting up simulation cases:

- Set up 1D, 2D and 3D grids using scripting syntax
- Templates for different types of battery chemistry parameters in JSON format
- Support for a variety of open formats
- Read in input data prepared in the MATLAB version of BattMo (coin-cell, jellyroll, pouch)
- Make use of common BattMo JSON format to run cases


## Installation

To install Julia, first visit the official Julia website at <https://julialang.org> and
[download](https://julialang.org/downloads/ ) the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or
Linux).  After installation, you can verify it by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing julia to start the
Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). This will confirm that Julia is correctly installed and ready for use.

BattMo is registered in the General Julia registry. To add it to your Julia environment, open Julia and run

```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.add("BattMo")
```

For those which are not used to Julia, you should be aware that julia uses JIT compilation. The first time the code is
run, you will therefore experience a compilation time which will not be present in the further runs.

### Getting started

We start by loading BattMo

```@example intro
using BattMo
```

BattMo uses a json input format. Json files can be easily read and modified. They are converted to dictionary structure

Let us choose the case
[p2d_40.json](https://github.com/BattMoTeam/BattMo.jl/blob/main/test/data/jsonfiles/p2d_40.json). We load it using the
function `readBattMoJsonInputFile`.

```@example intro
filename = string(dirname(pathof(BattMo)), "/../test/data/jsonfiles/p2d_40.json")
inputparams = readBattMoJsonInputFile(filename)
nothing # hide
```

We run the simulation using the [run_battery](@ref) 

```@example intro
output = run_battery(inputparams)
nothing # hide
``` 
We can now plot the results

```@example intro
using GLMakie
states = output[:states]
t = [state[:Control][:ControllerCV].time for state in states]
E = [state[:Control][:Phi][1] for state in states]
I = [state[:Control][:Current][1] for state in states]
fig = Figure()
ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], ylabel = "Voltage / V", xlabel = "Time / s", title = "Discharge curve")
lines!(ax, t, E)
ax = Axis(fig[1, 2], ylabel = "Voltage / V", xlabel = "Time / s", title = "Discharge curve")
lines!(ax, t, I)
fig
```
